Ah, got it—you want to use **Netcat (`nc`) itself** to simulate both a **TCP server** and an **SSH-like server** (i.e., a basic shell over TCP). Let’s build a clean, well-formatted Markdown page for that:

---

## 🔌 TCP and SSH-like Servers Using Netcat (`nc`) in WSL and Windows

### 📌 Overview
Netcat (`nc`) can act as a lightweight TCP server or even simulate a basic SSH-like shell. This guide shows how to set up:
- A **TCP server** using `nc`
- A **remote shell (SSH-like)** using `nc` between WSL and Windows

---

## 🖥️ 1. TCP Server with Netcat

### 🧰 Start TCP Server (Listener)
Run this on **WSL or Windows**:
```bash
nc -l -p 5555
```
- `-l`: Listen mode
- `-p 5555`: Port to listen on

### 🧪 Connect from the Other Side
From the other environment (WSL or Windows):
```bash
nc <target-ip> 5555
```

> 💡 You can now type messages back and forth—like a chat over TCP.

## 🔐 2. SSH-like Shell with Netcat

### ⚠️ Warning
This method is **not secure**. It sends everything in plaintext and should only be used in safe, local environments for testing or learning.

---

### 🧰 Start Shell Server (WSL)
```bash
nc -l -p 4444 -e /bin/bash
```
- `-e /bin/bash`: Executes Bash when a client connects

> 🛑 Some versions of `nc` (like OpenBSD's) **do not support `-e`** for security reasons. Use `ncat` from Nmap or `socat` as alternatives if needed.

---

### 🧪 Connect from Windows
```bash
nc <WSL IP> 4444
```
You’ll now have a remote shell into WSL from Windows.

---

### 🔁 Reverse Shell (Optional)
To simulate a reverse shell from WSL to Windows:
```bash
# On Windows (listener)
nc -l -p 4444

# On WSL (client)
nc <Windows IP> 4444 -e /bin/bash
```

---

## 🧯 Troubleshooting

- **No `-e` support**: Try `ncat` from [Nmap](https://nmap.org/ncat/) or use `socat`
- **Firewall blocks**: Allow chosen ports in Windows Defender Firewall
- **WSL IP changes**: Use `ip addr` or `cat /etc/resolv.conf` to find current IP
